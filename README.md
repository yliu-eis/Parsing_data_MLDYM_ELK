# Parsing_data_MLDYM_ELK
An initial version of parsing data from ELK for MLDYM. Unless it is not 2019, the python file will download all available data and save it to csv file for the month each time you run it. The reason I keep it for 2019 now is because maybe the format of elasticsearch index might change for different years.
